## About the Collection

This digital library includes a curated selection of twenty-nine miniature books drawn from the Lilly Library’s infamous miniatures collection—one of the largest in the world. The core of the Lilly’s collection is Ruth E. Adomeit’s mighty assemblage of miniature books, donated to the Lilly after her death in the early 1990s. The Lilly’s collection of miniatures (and the pieces gathered here) descends directly from Adomeit’s personal collection, which itself demonstrates a sweeping breadth of the book as an object. Adomeit—-an Ohio schoolteacher with a hybrid collecting and travelling bug—-collected miniature books indiscriminately wherever she went, embracing the book arts in all its forms, folds, gizmos and gadgets.

We rarely pause to consider that our engagement with a book extends beyond the text itself. Every reading encounter is also a physical one. Imagine searching for a title and discovering it materializes not as a brick-thick codex but as a thin, oversized picture-book-like object. Or recall the small spark of joy that comes from opening a pop-up book. The book’s body shapes our experience as much as its words, we just don’t notice it.

Miniature books, by definition, defy conventional expectations of scale—becoming a fraction (or a fraction of a fraction) of what we think the scale of a “normal” book should be. But the twenty-nine books showcased here push that defiance even further. These minis are also artists’ books and/or movable books. They incorporate sculptural structures, unique custom enclosures, and other multisensory features that invite the “reader” to engage with a book as an interactive piece of art, combining the ways in which we interact with these two (normally) distinct media types.

Foundationally, this project aims to convey the uniqueness and artistry of these items through metadata and detailed visual documentation. But more importantly, it seeks to nudge (or lightly shove) the viewer toward an expanded understanding of what a book can be -- an object, a piece of art, an experience, or something in between.
